# Fake-Card-Detection

The objective of this paper is to develop a method for detecting fake card. In this project, PAN cards have been analyzed to identify fraudulent cases using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). SSIM is a technique used to compare the structural similarity between two images, helping to determine whether a given card is authentic or forged. The approach focuses on image processing techniques to assess the validity of the card based on key visual features and structural consistency.
